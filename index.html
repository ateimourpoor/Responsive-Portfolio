    <img src="assets/images/20170624_143852.png"/>
<p>I moved to US about 5 years ago from Iran where I was born and grew up. I lived in Boston for a year where I got my MBA nd then I moved down here in Atlanta for my first Job in United States. I still miss Boston a lot. I had a great time there and made some amazing friends. I like Atlanta too but I'm not sure if it is as much fun as Boston,
    But I definitely prefer the weather here though.  </p>
<p>I'm a big Soccer fan. My fav team is Manchester United. One of my dreams is to someday visit Old Trafford where Manchester United plays its
    games. I've never been to UK, but I.'m planning to do that as soon as I graduate from BootCamp</p>
